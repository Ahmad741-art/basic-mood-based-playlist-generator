# basic-mood-based-playlist-generator

How It Works:
SONG_DATABASE:

A dictionary that stores sample songs categorized by mood. In a real application, you would replace this with calls to a music API like Spotify.
MoodBasedPlaylistGenerator Class:

select_mood: Prompts the user to select a mood from a list of available moods.
generate_playlist: Randomly selects a small playlist (e.g., 3 songs) from the songs available for the chosen mood.
display_playlist: Displays the generated playlist to the user.
Example Usage:

The user is prompted to select their current mood.
The app generates a playlist based on that mood by shuffling and selecting a few songs.
The generated playlist is displayed to the user.
How to Run:
Save the script as mood_playlist.py.
Run the script using Python (python mood_playlist.py).
Follow the prompts to select a mood and view the generated playlist.
Next Steps:
To extend this basic concept into a fully functional application:

Integrate with a Music API: Use the Spotify API to fetch real songs dynamically.
Build a GUI: Develop a user interface using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or a web framework like Flask.
Add More Moods and Features: Include more moods, dynamic playlist length, and options for users to refine the playlist based on genre preferences.
